      ##### <span style="color: lightblue;"> About me: </span>
      I'm a rising senior at Stanford University, majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Biology. 

      I believe that the future of humanity is sweetly nestled in the intersection of these two fields; 
      hardware innovation will enable at-scale distribution of advances in BCIs, health sensing/treatments, 
      and biomanufacturing -- technologies that will improve lives at a scale of n >> 1,000,000. 

      I'm particularly interested in developing systems that leverage progress across EE and Biology. I'm also interested in developing coherent technology policy that leaves room for R&D, public buy-in, and accessibility for all.
    
      In my free time, I love spearfishing, playing spikeball, and thinking about things that make me feel small: the brain, the ocean, and the stars. 
      
      ##### <span style="color: lightblue;"> Favorite quotes: </span>
      > "The brain is the organ of destiny. It holds within its humming mechanism secrets that will determine the future of the human race" -- Wilder Penfield
      
      > "If we have learned one thing from the history of invention and discovery, it is that in the long run, and often in the short one, the most daring prophecies seem laughably conservative" -- Arthur C. Clarke

      > "I am a victim of a series of accidents, as we are all" -- Kurt Vonnegut

      > "The purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved" -- Kurt Vonnegut

      > "I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy?... Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books..." -- Franz Kafka

      - title: Population Activity in Balanced Spiking Neural Networks after Neuron Loss
        content: |-
          I designed, developed, and tested an SNN that simulates ischemic attacks within large, biologically-plausible populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
          By exposing these networks to tasks of various complexities, and sweeping neuroscience-inspired hyperparameters, I discovered that a family of similar coactivity matrices enables latent dynamics capable of leading to the same behavioral output. The size and spread of this family is constrained by the E/I balance of the network, 
          and suggests that robustness to ablation could stem from the existence of multiple solution spaces in a continuous activity manifold.
