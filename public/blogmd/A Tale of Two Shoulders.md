About a year and a half ago, skiing through the Colorado backcountry, I tripped on a hidden branch and suffered one of the most excruciating injuries of my life: an anterior shoulder dislocation. Ski patrol tried, and failed, to reduce it on the slopes. After an hour of snowmobiles, vans, and gritted teeth, an ER doctor finally slid my shoulder back in place.

Around the same time, my cousin, same age, height, build, and activity level, dislocated his shoulder while playing basketball in Greece. Like me, he ended up in the ER. Like me, he was told he needed surgery.

Dislocations happen when the ball of the shoulder joint pops out of its shallow socket. With every dislocation, the risk of recurrent dislocations increases exponentially, especially in younger, active people. Consequently, when we visited the hospital, we were told roughly the same thing: you're high risk for re-injury, and surgery would help restore stability and protect your range of motion.

I had my surgery in Ohio at one of the top orthopedic centers in the U.S.; my cousin had his in Athens at one of Greece’s best clinics. We both received wonderful care, had similar physical therapy regimens, and got back to the sports we loved within a few months. 

A year later, I was climbing when my shoulder dislocated again, same excruciating pain, same ER routine. This time, though, frustration outweighed pain: how had my “fixed” shoulder failed, while my cousin’s was holding strong?

Digging deeper, even though our dislocations were physically similar, our surgeries were not. I received a [Bankart Repair](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/bankart-lesion-glenoid-labrum-tear), a minimally invasive method where surgeons reattach the torn cartilage to the shoulder socket. My cousin received a [Latarjet Procedure](https://www.windsorupperlimb.com/procedures/shoulder-procedures/open-stabilisation-latarjet-procedure), a much more invasive technique that reinforces the socket with a bone graft from the shoulder blade, creating a physical and muscular barrier against future dislocations. The Latarjet is [more durable for active people](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39151667/) with a high risk of recurrence, while having a [ten-times higher complication rate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5518960/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). In the U.S., the default standard of care is still the Bankart repair, even though studies show it’s [54% more likely to lead to long-term instability](https://surgicoll.scholasticahq.com/article/90553) in high-risk patients.

When I asked my surgeons why they didn’t do the Latarjet in the first place, their answers were vague: it’s more invasive, more complicated, not typically first-line. It seemed like they were saying, implicitly, “Let’s wait until the Bankart fails, and then we’ll escalate.” But why wasn’t the better (if riskier) surgery done first, when it could’ve saved me from going through all this twice?


> Why is our medical system so afraid of doing the right thing the first time?

My experience isn’t just a personal frustration but a symptom of a deeper flaw in U.S. healthcare. [Defensive medicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3728884/) happens when doctors make clinical decisions not just based on medical need, but on legal risk. In my case, the Latarjet might have offered better long-term outcomes but came with more potential complications, and therefore, more legal liability. So the safer option, from a malpractice perspective, won out.

The concept of defensive medicine first gained traction in the U.S. [in the late 1960s](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8783809/), when malpractice lawsuits began to spike. Today, it's pervasive. Nearly [one in three](https://gmedical.com/blog/international-locum-tenens-malpractice/) U.S. doctors has been sued during their career. That kind of legal exposure actively shapes how doctors practice. “Positive” defensive medicine leads to excessive, costly tests; “negative” defensive medicine, like in my case, means avoiding higher-risk treatments, even when they’re more appropriate.

By contrast, my cousin’s doctor had no such pressure. Many European countries operate under no-fault medical systems, where physicians aren’t personally liable for adverse outcomes and patients can receive compensation without proving negligence. In Sweden and New Zealand, if you’re injured, [you’re paid by the state](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/malpractice-do-other-countries-hold-key). Doctors aren’t dragged to court, and clinical decisions are made with medicine, not lawsuits, in mind. Greece, while still operating under a fault-based system like the U.S., [doesn’t have the same volume of malpractice litigation](https://journals.lww.com/amjforensicmedicine/abstract/2003/03000/medical_aspects_of_malpractice_crisis_in_greece_.14.aspx) or the same culture of legal fear. Though patients can, and often do, pursue claims through both civil and even criminal courts, the pace is slow and the process unpredictable. The result is that doctors still feel some pressure, but not the same ever-present liability paranoia that drives American defensive medicine.

The difference isn’t just theoretical. Researchers studying U.S. military hospitals, where active-duty patients cannot sue their doctors, found that physicians spent [5% less on inpatient care without any decline in patient outcomes](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24846). When veterans were shifted from lawsuit-immune military providers to civilian ones, costs rose, but health outcomes didn’t improve. By another estimate, defensive medicine accounts for [5–9% of all U.S. healthcare spending](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2005/anderson-health-spending). In 2021, with healthcare expenditures nearing $4 trillion, even the low end of that estimate translates to hundreds of billions of dollars annually in unnecessary costs, on tests, procedures, and repeat hospitalizations that don’t make patients healthier.

By compensating more patients directly and bypassing the tort system, a no-fault model could [cover three times more victims while costing the same](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/malpractice-do-other-countries-hold-key) as current malpractice premiums. Yet such reforms would face steep resistance, from the trial bar, entrenched bureaucracy, and the inertia of a system more afraid of risk than failure. As with so much in American governance, we’ve overcorrected for liability and undercorrected for trust. Doctors work in constant fear of punishment for doing the wrong thing, even though they’re the ones who are supposed to be in the wheelhouse. 

I didn’t need a second surgery. I needed a system that let my doctors act like my cousin’s did: boldly, with clarity, and without fear of being punished for doing the thing they’re supposed to.
