      <description>A few days ago, a friend asked the following:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been wondering about the politics of unnatural technology. Like, what is the history of normalizing advancements that people find viscerally inhumane? Current technology in this bucket is pro-natal tech, BCI, cultivated meat, etc. Let me know if you have any thoughts or recommendations on what to read.&#xA;Two books come to mind that have helped me think about this. The first is Theodore Kaczynskiâ€™s Industrial Society and Its Future.</description>
