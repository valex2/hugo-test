I designed, developed, and tested an SNN that simulates ischemic attacks within large, biologically plausible populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

By exposing these networks to tasks of various complexities and sweeping neuroscience-inspired hyperparameters, I discovered that a family of similar coactivity matrices enables latent dynamics capable of leading to the same behavioral output. 

The size and spread of this family is constrained by the E/I balance of the network, and suggests that robustness to ablation could stem from the existence of multiple solution spaces in a continuous activity manifold.
