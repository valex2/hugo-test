Built a working computer system on a RPi from the ground up: starting in assembly and working from bare-metal. With no operating system safety net and extremely minimal use of libraries, I implemented the following in C: GPIO interface, memory allocator, string formatting and graphics libraries, shell, PS2 keyboard and mouse drivers.
